# foundations-landing-page

This is the last flexbox-exercise/-project. First I try to duplicate the template and rebuild it.

For tomorrow:

- Fix the margin around everything
- Center the alt-text in the images
- Make the first Sign-Up button smaller and delete its shadow.
- Increase the vertical gap in Section-01
